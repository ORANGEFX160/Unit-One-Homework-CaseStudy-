#  Case Study: *Unhedged*, the new gen app robo-adviser for everyone. 



## What is it 
 
 Unhedged is an Australian FinTech Company that is looking to shake up the robo-adviser industry by using next gen technology algorithmic trading. Unhedged was founded in December 2020 by co-founders Peter Bakker, Glen Vanbavinckhove and Saskia Allbers. 

 While co-founders Peter and Glen were working for hedge funds and investment banks the pair  realized that everyday retail investors did not have access to the advanced investment tools.They also noticed that there was a disconnect between the wealth fund manager and the client's funds under management that fees are charged regardless whether or not the result is positive or negative. Uhedged believe that the industry should move to a performance fee model structure as oppressed to the current fee for service model structure. 

Unhedged has  progressed through several funding rounds as follows:

* Pre-seed round raised $500,000 in November 2020.
*   Venture capital round raised $10,000 from two companies Littlebanc Advisors LLC and Palm Ventures. 
* Crowdfunding via crowdfunding website [Birchal](https://www.birchal.com/company/unhedged) and hit the minimum target of  $350,000 within 45 mintures, in total crowdfunding amount $2,344,053.

## Equal acess for all
Unhedged's recently launched apartificial intelligence algorithmic  robo-adviser app is now allowing  retail investors to have access to the advanced investing tools that  the co-founders Peter and Glenn were using while working at hedge funds, investment banks and consultanting with sophisticated investors. The company's target customer  base is Gen X, Gen Z and millennial's retail investors that are not happy with the current index like returns they are receiving from their existing rob-advisers or find it challenging to beat the market using DIY trading apps like Stockpot and Six Park which have a higher minimum investment Â $2,000
